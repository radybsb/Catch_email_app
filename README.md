# Catch_email_app
A simply web app to catch e-mails from a subscribe page

You can access the web app by the following link:

The app is based on:

- html;
- css;
- bootstrap;
- node.js;
- mailchimp API;
- heroku.

I deployed the app using the knowledge I got from "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp", a course made by Angela Yu/Udemy
